    NEW YORK â€” New York State legalized recreational marijuana this spring, a move that was part of a broader effort to address decades of drug arrests that have disproportionately targeted communities of color. 
    
    Under the new legislation, some New Yorkers convicted of low-level marijuana offenses either saw their criminal records erased or have been able to apply for expungement. The effects of that change are expected to be seen across New York City, where Black and Latino individuals have accounted for the vast majority of marijuana arrests in recent years.
 
    In the first three months of 2021, the quarter before the legislation was enacted, 90 percent of those arrested on marijuana charges in New York City were Black or Latino, according to police data analyzed by the NYCity News Service.
